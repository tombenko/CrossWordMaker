CrossWordMaker
==============

 This is just a hobby-project, nothing serious. The only cause of it is that no-
where in the net can a usable (and open-sourced) crossword puzzle editor. I have
therefore begun to learn the Java language, and, after some time, here is my
editor. Still it is under heavy development, but now is a little usable. A lot
of things are hardcoded yet, just because I want the more important things to
work. Now you can edit a 21x13 puzzle with letters and black squares, but I want
to have editable borderlines to the squares and a way to have any size of puzz-
le.

 Because of these developments theres is no installer nor version numbering.
But will be when the minimum functionality I would like to have is done.

 Now the useful informations:
	* all letter wil be uppercase, anyway you wrote;
	* the cursor is invisible, I don't take care it yet (too lazy to do)
	* once a letter is given in a square, the cursor goes to the next square
		if any
	* dot (.) marks the black square
	* with the spacebar you can toggle the cursors moving orientation bet-
		ween horizontal and vertical
	* delete deletes the letter in the square
	* you can take the cursor into any square with the mouse.

Now that's all.
